    <div class="text">
      <p>I moved to Barcelona, Spain in 2016 to start a new life and to pursue my love for painting and photography. After a year of creating and selling artwork and then another year studying a Masters, I started to develop a love for design and to my greatest delight, I won a scholarship to study UX/UI in Ironhack Madrid. With the course now finishing in April 2019, I am looking to gain profesional experience building products of value and ideally bringing positive impact to society.</p>

      <p> also used my time in Spain to learn Spanish which is now at a high level, currently working as an Internal Recruiter in Madrid. Moving from England to Spain made a huge impact on the development of my life skills and I would truly recommend moving abroad to anyone.</p>

      <p>Being a creative person, I am looking for a Junior design position where I can develop my skills in UX, UI, and Art direction.</p>
